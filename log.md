# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started a new Nest project, learning authentication with JWT and using bcrypt to hash the users' password. I also learned how to use the "projects" tab on Github and I plan to keep using it to keep track of my features.

**Thoughts:** I am really excited about keeping this project (100 days of code) going and hope to finish the authentication app and start new ones.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
